# Start2Impact Full Stack Development "JS Advanced" Project - Life's Quality
Hi! This is my "JS Advanced" project created as part of the Full Stack Development master at Start2Impact. The project is built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Teleport API. I deployed this project at --> https://s2i-lifequality.netlify.app/

## Project Overview
City Living Index is a web application that allows users to see the quality of life scores for various cities. Users can enter the name of a city, and the application will retrieve and display information about the city's quality of life across different categories.

## Features
- **City Search**: Enter the name of a city in the search bar to see its quality of life scores.

- **Teleport Scores**: View scores for different quality of life categories, such as cost of living, safety, education, and more.

- **Total Score**: The application calculates a total score for the city and displays it along with a color-coded indicator (green, yellow, or red) based on the total score.

- **Summary**: Read a summary of the city's quality of life based on the provided data.
